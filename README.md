# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to understand the factors contributing to customer attrition. The goal is to identify patterns and trends that lead to churn and to provide actionable insights to improve customer retention. The analysis is divided into four main areas: customer demographics, churn analysis, product usage, and financial analysis.

## Key Objectives

1. **Customer Demographics:** Understand the distribution of customers across different age groups and gender.
2. **Churn Analysis:** Analyze churn rates, reasons for churn, and identify patterns among churned customers.
3. **Product Usage:** Identify commonly used products and analyze usage patterns across customer segments.
4. **Financial Analysis:** Compare the financial characteristics of churned versus non-churned customers.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `CustomerId`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `Surname`: Surname of the customer
- `CreditScore`: Credit score of the customer
- `Geography`: Location of the customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Tenure`: Number of years the customer has been with the company
- `Balance`: Account balance of the customer
- `NumOfProducts`: Number of products the customer is using
- `HasCrCard`: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `IsActiveMember`: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `EstimatedSalary`: Estimated salary of the customer
- `churned`: Whether the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

## Tools and Libraries
